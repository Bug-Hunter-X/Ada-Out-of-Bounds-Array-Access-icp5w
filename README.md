# Ada Out-of-Bounds Array Access Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside its declared bounds.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version that handles potential index errors gracefully.

This example highlights the importance of careful array indexing to avoid runtime exceptions and ensure program stability.
